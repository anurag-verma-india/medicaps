# Types of relationship
- 1. Association - objects of both classes are independent __Like a method of class A uses an object of class B__
  ```cpp
  class B;
  class A {
    int a
    public:
    void input() {
        //
    }
    void display1(B objB)
    {
        objB.display2();
        objB.input2();
    }
  }
  ```
- 2. Aggregation
- 3. Composition
- 4. Inheritance
Note: relation can be unidirectional or bidirectional
