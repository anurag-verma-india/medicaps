# Synchronous data transmission
Synchronous data transmission is used when we know when the data will be available to be transmitted

# Components
- Clock Signal
- Starting character
- Data block
- Ending Character

# Clock Signal
a clock signal is an electronic logic signal (voltage or current) which oscillates between a high and a low state at a constant frequency

# Data Block
| SYN | SYN | SOH | Header | STX | Text | ETX | BCC |

> - SYN: Synchronous idle
> - SOH: Start of heading
> - STX: Start of text
> - ETH: End of text
> - BCC: a block check character (Longitudinal / Cyclic Redundancy Check)

# Example
- Video Conferencing
- Transferring files between two devices
- Telephone conversations

## Advantages
- Large volumes of data can be transmitted.
- Connected devices can communicate in real time.
- Data is sent continuously, without pauses between bytes.
- Timing errors are reduced.

## Disadvantages
- The clocks of both the sender and the receiver must operate at the same frequency, simultaneously.
- Accuracy depends upon the receiverâ€™s capacity to accurately and precisely count the received bits.

# Conclusion
