## Synchronous Transmission
Synchronous data transmission is a type of data transfer that carries a frequent stream of data in the form of signals along with timing signals generated by an electric clock that ensures the synchronization of the sender and receiver. Synchronous transmission allows data to be transmitted in fixed intervals in the form of frames or blocks.

<!-- ## Asynchronous Transmission
Asynchronous transmission is a type of data transmission which works on start and stop bits. In Asynchronous transmission, each character contains its start and stop bit and irregular interval of time between them. -->

## Components
- sender
- receiver
- clock signal
- Data block

> ### Sender
> Message sender: (in synchronous transmission, typically a I/O device i.e. scanner, keyboard, or in old computer's terminal, or CPU)
> ### Receiver 
> Message receiver: same
> ### Data block
> an entire block of characters is transmitted, each character has a parity bit for the receiver to check. After the entire block is sent, the transmitter sends one more character that constitutes a parity over the length of the message. This character is called a longitudinal redundancy check (LRC) and is the accumulation of the exclusive-OR of all transmitted characters. The receiving station calculates the LRC as it receives characters and compares it with the transmitted LRC. The calculated and received LRC should be equal for error-free messages. If the receiver finds an error in the transmitted block, it informs the sender to retransmit the same block once again

> ### Clock Signal
> Acc. to Wikipedia
> In electronics and especially synchronous digital circuits, a clock signal is an electronic logic signal (voltage or current) which oscillates between a high and a low state at a constant frequency and is used like a metronome to synchronize actions of digital circuits. In a synchronous logic circuit, the most common type of digital circuit, the clock signal is applied to all storage devices, flip-flops and latches, and causes them all to change state simultaneously, preventing race conditions.

<!-- ## Features of Synchronous Data Transfer
### Timing
In synchronous data transfer, the data transfer is synchronized with a common clock signal that is generated by the sending device and used by both the sending and receiving devices. This ensures that both devices are in sync and ready to receive or transmit data at the same time.

### Data Transfer Modes
Synchronous data transfer can be done using either the parallel or serial mode of data transfer. In parallel data transfer, multiple bits of data are transferred simultaneously, while in serial data transfer, data is transferred bit-by-bit using a single data line.

### Handshaking
Synchronous data transfer typically involves some form of handshaking between the sending and receiving devices to ensure that the data is transferred correctly. This can involve the use of signals such as Acknowledge (ACK) and Ready (RDY), which indicate that the receiving device is ready to receive or that the sending device has completed the transfer.

### Data Rate
The data transfer rate in synchronous data transfer is typically limited by the clock frequency and the number of bits that can be transferred in a single clock cycle. However, synchronous data transfer can be faster than asynchronous data transfer because there is no need to add extra bits for synchronization.

### Transmission Line
In synchronous data transfer, the transmission line used to transfer data must be properly designed and matched to the impedance of the devices to ensure that data is not lost due to reflections. -->

## Example
- Video Conferencing
- Transferring files between two devices
- Telephone conversations

## Advantages
- Large volumes of data can be transmitted.
- Connected devices can communicate in real time.
- Data is sent continuously, without pauses between bytes.
- Timing errors are reduced.

## Disadvantages
- The clocks of both the sender and the receiver must operate at the same frequency, simultaneously.
- Accuracy depends upon the receiverâ€™s capacity to accurately and precisely count the received bits.

## Questions
- Why do we have to use clock signals?
> To prevent race conditions, i.e. if there is no fixed time for data transmission the CPU may interpret two 0s one because the low voltage is there for only a certain period of time

- What if a control character is sent in text transmission?
> Data transparency - Each control character is preceded by DLE (Data Link Escape) and if a control character occurs in the body by any chance then it is not interpreted as such because it is not preceded by a DLE (If a DLE accidentally occurs in the body another DLE is inserted before it to signify that the upcoming bits are not control bits)
